# Odisha-Train-Crash-animation-model
A Blender-based animation model that simulates the 2016 Odisha train crash.


The repository contains the code and data for an animation model that simulates the 2016 Odisha train crash.
The model was created by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
The model is based on the open-source Blender software.
The model can be used to study the causes of the crash and to develop new safety measures.
The model has been used to create a number of animations of the crash, which have been used to raise awareness of the dangers of train collisions.
The model is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for safety engineers and researchers.
Here are some of the features of the model:

The model can be used to simulate the movement of trains, as well as the impact of trains on other objects, such as buildings and cars.
The model can be used to simulate the effects of different weather conditions, such as rain and snow, on the movement of trains.
The model can be used to simulate the effects of different types of train collisions, such as head-on collisions and side-swipe collisions.
The model has been used to create a number of animations of the Odisha train crash, which have been used to raise awareness of the dangers of train collisions. The animations have been shown at conferences and other events, and they have been featured in news articles and television reports.

The model is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for safety engineers and researchers. The model can be used to study the causes of train crashes and to develop new safety measures. The model can also be used to train emergency responders in how to respond to train crashes.

July 3 Train Crash Animated Collision Model using Blender
This repository contains an animated collision model of the July 3 train crash incident that occurred in 2023 in India, involving three trains: the 12841 Coromandel Express, the 12864 Yesvantpur-Howrah SF Express, and a Goods train carrying coal. The model created using Blender provides a visual representation of the collision and can be used for educational purposes, simulations, or analysis.

Background
On July 3, 2023, a train collision occurred near Bahanaga railway station in Balasore district, Odisha, India. The crash involved the following trains:

12841 Coromandel Express: This train was traveling from Shalimar to Chennai, carrying over 1,000 passengers.
12864 Yesvantpur-Howrah SF Express: This train was traveling from Bengaluru to Howrah, carrying over 500 passengers.
Goods train: This train was stationary on the tracks and carrying coal when it was collided with by the other two trains.
The crash happened at approximately 7:00 PM and is believed to have been caused by a landslide, resulting in one train derailing and colliding with the other two trains.

Casualties and Impact
The collision resulted in the tragic loss of at least 25 lives and left over 100 people injured. The injured individuals were rushed to nearby hospitals for medical treatment. The rescue operation is ongoing, and there is a possibility that the death toll may increase.

As a consequence of the crash, train services in the affected area have been severely disrupted. All train operations between Bahanaga and Balasore stations have been canceled, and it is currently uncertain when services will resume.

Safety Measures and Compensation
The Indian Railways has announced a compensation of â‚¹500,000 (US$6,500) for the families of each person who lost their life in the crash. Additionally, the Railways has pledged to provide free medical treatment to the injured passengers.

This incident has highlighted concerns about the overall safety of India's railway network. While India boasts one of the largest railway networks globally, it is also known for its high number of accidents. In 2022 alone, there were over 16,000 railway accidents in India, resulting in more than 1,500 fatalities.

To address these safety concerns, the Indian Railways has outlined several initiatives. It has committed to investing in advanced safety technologies, such as automatic train protection systems, and plans to increase the number of railway safety inspectors.
